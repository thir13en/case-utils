### Inference
Inferences are steps in reasoning, moving from premises to logical consequences; etymologically, the word infer means to "carry forward". Inference is theoretically traditionally divided into **deduction** and **induction**, a distinction that in Europe dates at least to Aristotle (300s BCE). **Deduction is inference deriving logical conclusions from premises known or assumed to be true**, with the laws of valid inference being studied in logic. **Induction is inference from particular premises to a universal conclusion**. A **third type** of inference is sometimes distinguished, notably by Charles Sanders Peirce, contradistinguishing **abduction from induction**. 

### Proof
A mathematical proof is an inferential argument for a mathematical statement, showing that the stated assumptions logically guarantee the conclusion.

### Set
A `Collection` of things that are referred to as `Elements` of the Set.

### Operation Properties
#### Commutativity
The order of the operands does NOT affect the result of the operation.
