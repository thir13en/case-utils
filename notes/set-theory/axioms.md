# Axioms

### Axiom of Extension
A `Set` is determined by what it's elements are, **not the specific order in which thay are presented or the fact that one element might be listed more than once**.
```
A = {1,3,3,4,3,5,6,3,7} # this set has 6 elements
# equals
B = {1,2,4,5,6,7} # this set has 6 elements
```
So the `elements` are the entities that are unique, regardless on how many times appear.

### De Morgan's laws
```
(A ∪ B)c = Ac ∩ Bc
(A ∩ B)c = Ac ∪ Bc
```
