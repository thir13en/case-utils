# Notation

### Set Builder Notation
The syntax to create and define sets, for example:
```
The set with all the shapes, such as the shapes are Blue

# x -> all the shapes
# y -> is blue
# | -> means SUCH THAT

{ x | x = y }
```
Example: with the following set A of elements: -5, 4, 2, 8, -6, -1, create a set with only the negative elements:  
```
{ x ∈ A | x < 0 }
```
The set with all the real numbers between -2 and 5:
```
{ x ∈ ℝ | -2 < x < 5 }
```
For all elements of a set A:
```
∀ x ∈ A
```
