# Types of Sets

### Universal Set
Contains EVERYTHING. Noted `U`

### Empty/Null Set
Contains NOTHING. Noted `∅` read `phy`. It is important to note that `{} != 0`.

### Singleton Set
Contains exactly ONE element, i.e. {1}.

### Finite Set
Any set that contains a FINITE amount of elements. You note them by adding all elements to the set.

### Infinite Set
A Set with infinitely many elements, you note it with ellipsis. For instance, the set of the integers:
{..., -2, -1, 0, 1,,2, ...}

### Subset
A set that contains only a subgroup of the elements in another set, such as that `B` is a subset of `A` if:
```
∀ x ∈ B => x ∈ A
```
