Deriving from Bertrand Russell's **Type Theory**

### Set
A `Collection` of things that are referred to as `Elements` of the Set.

### Notation
```
SetName = {element1, element2... elementn}
# SetName tends to be a capital letter: A, B, C...
```
To notate that there is an undefinite amount of non listed elements, you do so with `ellipses`
```
SetName = { element1, element2... }
# these wrapping brackets are named set brackets or braces
```
The symbol to determine that an `element` belongs to a `set` is ∈.
```
A = {b, 1, 0} => b ∈ A, 1 ∈ A, 0 ∈ A
```
The symbol to determine that an `element` does NOT belong to a `set` is ∉.
```
A = {b, 1, 0} => 7 ∉ A
```

### Cardinality of a Set
The total amount of elements that a Set has, noted as `n(SetName)`.

### Equivalent Sets
Two sets are equivalent if they have the SAME amount of elements, doesn't matter if the elements themselves match or not.
