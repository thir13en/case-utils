### Cartesian Plane
Is an application of the Cartesian Product, two axis, x and y, which contains an infinite amount of numbers in both axes and represent a bi-dimensional space typically, thou it can be an n-dimensional space. It is interesting to note that a point in the cartesian plane is the cartesian product of two sets that contain a number in each axis each. So to get all the points, we can do the following Cartesian Product:
```
ℝ x ℝ
```
To do it in three dimensions:
```
ℝ x ℝ x ℝ
```
