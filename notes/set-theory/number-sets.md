# Number Sets


### Natural Numbers
∈ ℕ
Whole numbers from 1 or 0 (depending on interpretation), upwards. { 0,1,2,3,4... }.

### Integers
∈ ℤ
Whole numbers including negative numbers (depending on interpretation), upwards. { ...-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4... }.  
We can note that ℕ ∈ ℤ.

### Rational Numbers
∈ ℚ
Numbers that we can have by having the ratio of two integers. {...3/4,3/2....}
We can note that ℤ ∈ ℚ.

### Irrational Numbers
∈ ~ℚ
Numbers that we cannot represent have by having the ratio of two integers. {...π,e, sqrt(2)...}

### Real Numbers
∈ ℝ
Both Rational and Irrational Numbers
We can note that {ℚ, ~ℚ} ∈ ℝ.

### Imaginary/Complex Numbers
∈ ℂ
Numbers such as when you square them you obtain a negative value. They are named imaginary because indeed they do not exist in the field of non-imagined reality. **Complex numbers** is a combination of a `Real` part and an `Imaginary` one. 
They have the following syntax:
```
a + bi WHERE i² = -1
```
Where `a` is the `Real` part and `bi` is the `Imaginary` one. For example:
```
sqrt(-9) = sqrt(9) * sqrt(-1) = 3i
```
ℂ = { Imaginary, ℝ }
