# Game Theory


### Nash equilibrium
In game theory, the Nash equilibrium, named after the mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr., is the most common way to **define the solution of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players**. In a Nash equilibrium, **each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players and no player has anything to gain by changing only his own strategy**. The principle of Nash equilibrium dates back to the time of Cournot, who applied it to competing firms choosing outputs.  

If each player has chosen a strategy—an action plan choosing his own actions based on what it has seen happen so far in the game—and no player can increase his own expected payoff by changing his strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices constitutes a Nash equilibrium.  

If two players Alice and Bob choose strategies A and B, (A, B) is a Nash equilibrium if Alice has no other strategy available that does better than A at maximizing her payoff in response to Bob choosing B, and Bob has no other strategy available that does better than B at maximizing his payoff in response to Alice choosing A. In a game in which Carol and Dan are also players, (A, B, C, D) is a Nash equilibrium if A is Alice's best response to (B, C, D), B is Bob's best response to (A, C, D), and so forth.   

### Prisoners Dilemma
The prisoner's dilemma is a standard example of a game analyzed in game theory that shows why two completely rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interests to do so. It was originally framed by Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher while working at RAND in 1950. Albert W. Tucker formalized the game with prison sentence rewards and named it "prisoner's dilemma", presenting it as follows:

    Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity either to betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible outcomes are:

        If A and B each betray the other, each of them serves two years in prison
        If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free and B will serve three years in prison
        If A remains silent but B betrays A, A will serve three years in prison and B will be set free
        If A and B both remain silent, both of them will serve only one year in prison (on the lesser charge).

### Tragedy of the Commons
The tragedy of the commons describes a situation in economic science when individual users, who have open access to a resource unhampered by shared social structures or formal rules that govern access and use, act independently according to their own self-interest and, contrary to the common good of all users, cause depletion of the resource through their uncoordinated action. The concept originated in an essay written in 1833 by the British economist William Forster Lloyd, who used a hypothetical example of the effects of unregulated grazing on common land (also known as a "common") in Great Britain and Ireland. The concept became widely known as the "tragedy of the commons" over a century later after an article written by Garrett Hardin in 1968.  
  
Although open-access resource systems may collapse due to overuse (such as in over-fishing), many examples have existed and still do exist where members of a community with regulated access to a common resource co-operate to exploit those resources prudently without collapse or even creating "perfect order". Elinor Ostrom was awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Economic science for demonstrating exactly this concept in her book Governing the Commons, which included examples of how local communities were able to do this without top-down regulations or privatization.
