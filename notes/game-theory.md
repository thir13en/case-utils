### Nash equilibrium
In game theory, the Nash equilibrium, named after the mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr., is the most common way to **define the solution of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players**. In a Nash equilibrium, **each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players and no player has anything to gain by changing only his own strategy**. The principle of Nash equilibrium dates back to the time of Cournot, who applied it to competing firms choosing outputs.  

If each player has chosen a strategy—an action plan choosing his own actions based on what it has seen happen so far in the game—and no player can increase his own expected payoff by changing his strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices constitutes a Nash equilibrium.  

If two players Alice and Bob choose strategies A and B, (A, B) is a Nash equilibrium if Alice has no other strategy available that does better than A at maximizing her payoff in response to Bob choosing B, and Bob has no other strategy available that does better than B at maximizing his payoff in response to Alice choosing A. In a game in which Carol and Dan are also players, (A, B, C, D) is a Nash equilibrium if A is Alice's best response to (B, C, D), B is Bob's best response to (A, C, D), and so forth.
