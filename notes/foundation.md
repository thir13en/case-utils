# Foundation


### Philosophical views
At the beginning of the 20th century, three schools of philosophy of mathematics opposed each other: **Formalism**, **Intuitionism** and **Logicism**.

### Formalism
In some cases these questions may be sufficiently answered through the study of formal theories, in disciplines such as reverse mathematics and computational complexity theory. As noted by Weyl, formal logical systems also run the risk of inconsistency; in Peano arithmetic, this arguably has already been settled with several proofs of consistency, but there is debate over whether or not they are sufficiently finitary to be meaningful. Gödel's second incompleteness theorem establishes that logical systems of arithmetic can never contain a valid proof of their own consistency. What Hilbert wanted to do was prove a logical system S was consistent, based on principles P that only made up a small part of S. But Gödel proved that the principles P could not even prove P to be consistent, let alone S.  

### Intuitionism 
Some modern theories in the philosophy of mathematics deny the existence of foundations in the original sense. Some theories tend to focus on mathematical practice, and aim to describe and analyze the actual working of mathematicians as a social group. Others try to create a cognitive science of mathematics, focusing on human cognition as the origin of the reliability of mathematics when applied to the real world. These theories would propose to find foundations only in human thought, not in any objective outside construct. The matter remains controversial.  

### Logicism
Logicism is a school of thought, and research programme, in the philosophy of mathematics, based on the thesis that mathematics is an extension of a logic or that some or all mathematics may be derived in a suitable formal system whose axioms and rules of inference are 'logical' in nature. Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead championed this theory initiated by Gottlob Frege and influenced by Richard Dedekind.  

### Intuitionism vs Formalism
In the philosophy of mathematics, **intuitionism, or neointuitionism** (opposed to preintuitionism), is an approach where mathematics is considered to be purely the result of the constructive mental activity of humans rather than the discovery of fundamental principles claimed to exist in an objective reality. That is, logic and mathematics are not considered analytic activities wherein deep properties of objective reality are revealed and applied, but are instead considered the application of internally consistent methods used to realize more complex mental constructs, regardless of their possible independent existence in an objective reality.  

### Hilbert's Program

In mathematics, Hilbert's program, formulated by German mathematician David Hilbert in the early part of the 20th century, was a proposed solution to the foundational crisis of mathematics, when early attempts to clarify the foundations of mathematics were found to suffer from paradoxes and inconsistencies. As a solution, Hilbert proposed to ground all existing theories to a finite, complete set of axioms, and provide a proof that these axioms were consistent. Hilbert proposed that the consistency of more complicated systems, such as real analysis, could be proven in terms of simpler systems. Ultimately, the consistency of all of mathematics could be reduced to basic arithmetic.  
To prove the consistency of mathematics was the **second problem** in the set of Hilbert's mathematics **23 problems**.

### Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem

Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem states and demonstrates that there is a **gap** between truth and proof, so there might be truths out there that are essentially impossible to proof mathematically.  

Gödel produced something named the **Gödel Coding**, he would assign code numbers to every Axiom of mathematics, so as to speak of mathematics **inside** of the realm of mathematical language. Here, basically he introduced the contradiction of a theoretical statement that goes like so:
```
This statement cannot be proved from the axioms
```
If this statement is **true**, then if mathematics is consistent there must be a way to proof it from the axioms, here you can feel the paradox, baby.  

Incompleteness points to the fact that **the basic set of axioms of maths can never be complete**.  

One of the Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem consequences is that something as human consciousness will never be able to be captured in what we today understand as computers.

#### Before

There was the **belief** that there would be ways to proof that mathematics are consistent, that there is no space for contradiction.  

### Today
In practice, most mathematicians either do not work from axiomatic systems, or if they do, do not doubt the consistency of **[ZFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory)**, generally their preferred axiomatic system. In most of mathematics as it is practiced, the incompleteness and paradoxes of the underlying formal theories never played a role anyway, and in those branches in which they do or whose formalization attempts would run the risk of forming inconsistent theories (such as logic and category theory), they may be treated carefully. 

### Axioms

A set of rules that are believed to be essential truths.
