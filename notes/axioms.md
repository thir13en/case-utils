# Axioms

In the **Posterior Analytics**, Aristotle (384â€“322 BC) laid down the axiomatic method for organizing a field of knowledge logically by means of **primitive concepts, axioms, postulates, definitions, and theorems**. Aristotle took a majority of his examples for this from arithmetic and from geometry. This method reached its high point with **Euclid's Elements (300 BC)**, a treatise on mathematics structured with very high standards of rigor: Euclid justifies each proposition by a demonstration in the form of chains of **syllogisms**. Aristotle's syllogistic logic, together with the axiomatic method exemplified by Euclid's Elements, are recognized as scientific achievements of ancient Greece.

```

```
a = b => b = a
```

```
a + b = c => b + a = c
