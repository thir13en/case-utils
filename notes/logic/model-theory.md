# Model Theory

In mathematics, **model theory** is the study of the **relationship between formal theories** (a collection of sentences in a formal language expressing statements about a mathematical structure), **and their models**, taken as interpretations that satisfy the sentences of that theory.  
Model theory recognizes and is intimately concerned with a **duality**: it examines **semantical** elements (**meaning and truth**) by means of **syntactical elements** (**formulas and proofs**) of a corresponding language.
