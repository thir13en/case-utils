# Logic

### Syllogism
A **syllogism** (Greek: συλλογισμός, syllogismos, 'conclusion, inference') is a kind of logical argument that applies **deductive reasoning** to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more **propositions** that are asserted or assumed to be true.

In a form, defined by Aristotle, from the combination of a general statement (the major premise) and a specific statement (the minor premise), a conclusion is deduced. For example, knowing that all men are mortal (major premise) and that Socrates is a man (minor premise), we may validly conclude that Socrates is mortal. Syllogistic arguments are usually represented in a three-line form:

    All men are mortal.
    Socrates is a man.
    Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
