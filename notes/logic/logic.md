# Logic

### Statements
Building blocks of logic, they are a `proposition` that must fulfil the condition of either being `true` or `false`. A statement cannot have incognitas, it has to be defined so as to directly infer from it if it is true or false. Normally you DON'T write the whole statement or proposition, but use a capital letter that represents it.

### Syllogism
A **syllogism** (Greek: συλλογισμός, syllogismos, 'conclusion, inference') is a kind of logical argument that applies **deductive reasoning** to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more **propositions** that are asserted or assumed to be true.

In a form, defined by Aristotle, from the combination of a general statement (the major premise) and a specific statement (the minor premise), a conclusion is deduced. For example, knowing that all men are mortal (major premise) and that Socrates is a man (minor premise), we may validly conclude that Socrates is mortal. Syllogistic arguments are usually represented in a three-line form:

    All men are mortal.
    Socrates is a man.
    Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

### The Laws of Logic
1. The Law of Identity: `P -> P`
1. The Law of Non-Contradiction: `P != !P`
1. The Law of Excluded Middle: `P v !P`

### Compound Statements
They are basically a set of several statement connected by `logical connectors`.

### Logical Connectors
* AND -> Conjunction
* OR  -> Disjunction
* NEGATION
