# Proof Theory

Proofs are typically presented as **inductively-defined data structures** such as plain **lists**, **boxed lists**, or **trees**, which are constructed according to the **axioms** and **rules of inference** of the logical system. As such, proof theory is **syntactic in nature**, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature.  
Some of the major areas of proof theory include **structural proof theory**, **ordinal analysis**, **provability logic**, **reverse mathematics**, **proof mining**, **automated theorem proving**, and **proof complexity**.
